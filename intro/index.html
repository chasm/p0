        Learning to be a web developer
      </h1>

      <p>
        This program begins your journey towards becoming a web developer. If
        you do not wish to work as a web developer, then this course will help
        you to understand what web developers do, which can help you in many
        other fields that deal with web developers and web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or you could use this material simply to enrich your life by helping
        you to understand one of the most important developments (pun intended)
        in human history.

      <h2 id="what-is-web-development-">What is web development?</h2>

      <p>
        From <cite>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Wikipedia</a>
        </cite>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing
          a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a
          private network). Web development can range from developing the
          simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex
          web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social
          network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web
          development commonly refers, may include web design, web content
          development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web
          server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In short, web developers build <strong style="color:red">Web
        sites</strong> and <strong style="color:red">Web applications</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As this is not limited to working on the World Wide Web, it is becoming
        more common to use the common noun &quot;web&quot; rather than the
        proper noun &quot;Web&quot; when referring to websites (often now one
        word) and web applications. We&#39;ll use them interchangeably here.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-is-a-website-">What is a website?</h3>

      <p>
        Again, from <cite>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">Wikipedia</a>
        </cite>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A website, also written as web site, or simply site, is a set of
          related web pages typically served from a single web domain. A
          website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a
          network such as the Internet or a private local area network through
          an Internet address known as a uniform resource locator (URL). All
          publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide
          Web.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The key here is that a website is a set of web
        <strong style="color:red">pages</strong>. Think of pages as
        <em>documents</em>. So websites tend to be <em>informational</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because websites consist mostly of markup and presentation, they can
        often be built without any real programming at all. This makes it easy
        for even novices to build simple websites with very little work.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, enterprise-quality websites involve extensive knowledge of
        myriad knowledge domains, from the specific domain (e.g., sports) that
        the website addresses, to such technical domains as information
        architecture, accessibility, usability, user experience, search engine
        optimization, marketing, security, privacy, law, and more.

      <h3 id="what-is-a-web-application-or-app-">
        What is a web application or app?
      </h3>

      <p>
        <cite>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">Wikipedia</a>
        </cite> one more time: &ldquo;In computing, a
        <strong style="color:red">web application</strong> or
        <strong>web app</strong> is a client-server software application in
        which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Hmm. So it runs in a web broswer. OK, then what is a
        <strong>software application</strong>?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Application software (an application) is a set of computer programs
          designed to permit the user to perform a group of coordinated
          functions, tasks, or activities. Application software cannot run on
          itself but is dependent on system software to execute. <cite>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">Wikipedia</a>
          </cite>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        OK, so application software is computer programs that run on other
        software (called an <em>operating system</em>) which runs on hardware
        (the computer itself).
      </p>

      <p>
        Web developers (or web <em>application</em> developers) write programs
        that run on operating systems inside other programs and are accessible
        through a browser across a network.
      </p>

      <p>
        How does this differ from a web page? Well, a web page is like a page
        in a book. It might have information, images, charts, etc., but mostly
        it just sits there.
      </p>

      <p>
        A web application is <strong style="color:red">interactive</strong>.
        The user interacts with it and changes it. The simplest example of a
        web application is a form that sends a contact message to the site
        owners. But there is much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Online games, spreadsheets, chat rooms, photo processors, music players,
        video players and recorders, etc. are all forms of web
        <em>applications</em>. Facebook, Twitter, AirBnB, Ãœber, Instagram,
        Pinterest, etc. are all web <em>applications</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The introductory portion of this course focuses on web <em>site</em>
        development and essential programming skills. The on-site portion of
        the course focuses on web <em>application</em> development.
