# Learning to be a web developer

This program begins your journey towards becoming a web developer. If you do not wish to work as a web developer, then this course will help you to understand what web developers do, which can help you in many other fields that deal with web developers and web applications.

Or you could use this material simply to enrich your life by helping you to understand one of the most important developments (pun intended) in human history.

## What is web development?

From <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development)</cite>:

> Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

In short, web developers build <strong style="color:red">Web sites</strong> and <strong style="color:red">Web applications</strong>.

As this is not limited to working on the World Wide Web, it is becoming more common to use the common noun "web" rather than the proper noun "Web" when referring to websites (often now one word) and web applications. We'll use them interchangeably here.

### What is a website?

Again, from <cite>[Wikipedia]()</cite>:

> A website, also written as web site, or simply site, is a set of related web pages typically served from a single web domain. A website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a uniform resource locator (URL). All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.

The key here is that a website is a set of web <strong style="color:red">pages</strong>. Think of pages as *documents*. So websites tend to be *informational*.

Because websites consist mostly of markup and presentation, they can often be built without any real programming at all. This makes it easy for even novices to build simple websites with very little work.

That said, enterprise-quality websites involve extensive knowledge of myriad knowledge domains, from the specific domain (e.g., sports) that the website addresses, to such technical domains as information architecture, accessibility, usability, user experience, search engine optimization, marketing, security, privacy, law, and more.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) is a website.

### What is a web application or app?

<cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application)</cite> one more time: "In computing, a <strong style="color:red">web application</strong> or **web app** is a client-server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser."

Hmm. So it runs in a web broswer. OK, then what is a **software application**?

> Application software (an application) is a set of computer programs designed to permit the user to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities. Application software cannot run on itself but is dependent on system software to execute. <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software)</cite>

OK, so application software is computer programs that run on other software (called an *operating system*) which runs on hardware (the computer itself).

Web developers (or web *application* developers) write programs that run on operating systems inside other programs and are accessible through a browser across a network.

How does this differ from a web page? Well, a web page is like a page in a book. It might have information, images, charts, etc., but mostly it just sits there.

A web application is <strong style="color:red">interactive</strong>. The user interacts with it and changes it. The simplest example of a web application is a form that sends a contact message to the site owners. But there is much more.

Online games, spreadsheets, chat rooms, photo processors, music players, video players and recorders, etc. are all forms of web *applications*. Facebook, Twitter, AirBnB, Ãœber, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. are all web *applications*.

The introductory portion of this course focuses on web *site* development and essential programming skills. The on-site portion of the course focuses on web *application* development.
